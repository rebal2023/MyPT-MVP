## Team

### Omar Jaber & Rebal Wehbi

- **Roles:**
  - Omar Jaber: Front-End
  - Rebal Wehbi: Back-End

- **Reasons for Roles:**
  Assigning roles in this way ensures that each team member can leverage their strengths and expertise effectively, leading to a more efficient and successful project outcome. Each team member can focus on their areas of expertise, collaborate effectively, and contribute to the project's success. This division of labor maximizes efficiency, minimizes errors, and ultimately leads to a high-quality product that meets the needs of users.

## Technologies

- **Languages:** JavaScript, HTML, CSS
- **Frameworks:** React for frontend development, Node.js for backend development
- **Libraries:** Redux for state management, Express.js for server-side routing
- **Database:** MongoDB for storing exercise data and user information
- **Tools:** Git for version control, VSCode as the integrated development environment (IDE)
- **Platform:** Web application deployed on AWS (Amazon Web Services)

- **Trade-offs and Decisions:**
  - **Frontend Framework:** React vs Angular
    React was chosen for its simplicity, virtual DOM, and strong community support. It allows for faster rendering of UI components and is more flexible in terms of integration with other libraries and frameworks. Angular, on the other hand, is a more opinionated framework with a steeper learning curve. While it provides more built-in features out of the box, it can be more cumbersome for smaller projects and may introduce unnecessary complexity. The decision to use React was made based on the team's familiarity with it and its suitability for the project's scale and requirements.
  - **Database:** MongoDB vs PostgreSQL
    MongoDB was selected for its flexibility and scalability, especially for handling unstructured data such as exercise information. It offers a JSON-like document model, which aligns well with the data structure of many fitness-related applications. PostgreSQL, on the other hand, is a relational database management system known for its ACID compliance and strong consistency. It is well-suited for applications with complex relationships between data entities. However, for My-PT, the non-relational nature of MongoDB better accommodates the dynamic and evolving nature of exercise data. Additionally, MongoDB's scalability makes it a more suitable choice for potential future expansion of the application.

## Challenge Statement

The My-PT project aims to address the challenge of effectively managing personalized workout routines and rehabilitation programs. It provides a solution for individuals who require structured exercise regimens tailored to their specific needs, whether for fitness training, physical therapy, or injury rehabilitation.

However, it will not replace professional medical advice or guidance from certified fitness trainers or physical therapists. While it can aid in organizing and tracking exercises, it does not provide personalized exercise recommendations or diagnoses.

The project primarily helps individuals who are seeking a convenient and customizable way to manage their exercise routines. This includes people undergoing physical therapy, athletes with specific training requirements, individuals recovering from injuries, or anyone looking to maintain or improve their fitness level.

This project is not dependent on a specific locale. Since it is a web-based application, it can be accessed and used by individuals worldwide, regardless of their location. However, it may need to comply with relevant regulations and guidelines regarding user data privacy and healthcare information security in different jurisdictions.

## Infrastructure

### Branching and Merging:

Our team will follow the GitHub flow branching model for version control. In this model, we will have a main branch, typically named `master` or `main`, which represents the stable version of the application. When working on new features or fixes, team members will create feature branches off the main branch. Once a feature is complete, it will undergo code review before being merged back into the main branch through a pull request. This approach allows for a clean and organized codebase, with each feature developed in isolation and thoroughly reviewed before integration.

### Deployment Strategy:

For deployment, we will utilize a continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipeline. Whenever changes are pushed to the main branch, automated tests will be triggered to ensure the stability and functionality of the application. Upon successful testing, the changes will be automatically deployed to the production environment. This automated deployment process reduces the risk of human error and ensures a seamless and efficient deployment workflow.

### Data Population:

Initially, our app will be populated with sample exercise data to demonstrate its functionality. Users will also have the option to manually input their own exercise routines and data. Additionally, we may integrate APIs or databases containing exercise information and recommendations to provide users with a wider range of options for their workouts.

### Testing Tools and Processes:

We will employ a combination of manual testing and automated testing to ensure the reliability and quality of our application. For automated testing, we will use tools such as Jest and React Testing Library for unit and integration testing of frontend components, and tools like Mocha and Chai for backend testing. We will also utilize end-to-end testing frameworks like Cypress to simulate user interactions and ensure the smooth functioning of the entire application. Continuous integration tools like Jenkins or GitHub Actions will be used to automate the testing process and provide immediate feedback on code changes. Additionally, we will conduct manual testing to evaluate the user experience and identify any usability issues that automated tests may overlook.

## Existing Solutions

- **MyFitnessPal**
  - Similarities: MyFitnessPal is a popular fitness app that allows users to track their exercise routines and nutritional intake. Like My-PT, it provides users with the ability to log workouts and monitor progress over time.
  - Differences: MyFitnessPal focuses more on nutrition tracking and calorie counting, whereas My-PT is specifically tailored for managing exercise routines and rehabilitation programs. My-PT offers more detailed timing cues, exercise scheduling, and feedback to physical therapists, which are not prominent features of MyFitnessPal.

- **Physiotec**
  - Similarities: Physiotec is an exercise prescription software used by physiotherapists to create personalized exercise programs for patients. Like My-PT, it allows users to access exercise instructions and track their progress.
  - Differences: Physiotec is primarily used by healthcare professionals to prescribe exercises to patients, whereas My-PT is designed for individual users to manage their own exercise routines. Physiotec may offer more advanced features for healthcare professionals, such as patient management and progress tracking, which may not be relevant for individual users.

- **Choice of Implementation:**
  While there are existing solutions like MyFitnessPal and Physiotec that offer some similar features to My-PT, we chose to reimplement a personalized workout companion based on specific user needs and requirements. My-PT focuses on providing detailed timing cues, customizable exercise scheduling, and seamless integration with physical therapy feedback, catering to individuals who require a more tailored approach to managing their exercise routines. By building a new solution from scratch, we have the flexibility to incorporate innovative features and design choices that directly address the needs of our target users, ensuring a more personalized and effective user experience.

## Features

- **Timing:** As you perform the exercise, you will hear and see cues that help you time each repetition (rep). Cues such as Prepare, Start, Release, Rest. Timing parameters can be fine-tuned down to the finest detail to match your pace exactly.
- **Counting:** You specify the number of reps and sets, and My-PT keeps track while you just follow the cues.
- **Scheduling:** Assign a schedule to each exercise, and My-PT will remind you when it is due.
- **Instructions:** You can enter instructions for each of your exercises by typing them into the exercise and/or by adding photos to the exercise. You can choose to automatically show or speak the instructions as you start the exercise. You can also record audio of your instructions if you prefer that. Thus, My

-PT also serves as a convenient place to keep all your exercise instructions.
- **Feedback to your physical therapist:** When you finish an exercise, you can mark the difficulty and make notes with questions or feedback to your therapist. You can generate a report that shows this information (PDF format) and email it to your therapist.
- **Workouts:** You can string multiple exercises together into workouts, which can play through your entire regimen automatically.

That’s it. What My-PT does not do for you is to provide any pre-defined exercises (other than a couple of examples). You enter each exercise according to your own needs or directions from a physiotherapist.
